1. Construct the simplest circuit(see images)
    REMEMBER, LEDs are DIODES, meaning they only allow current to flow in one direction.
        * The -/ground/cathode leg has a larger end inside of the LED and the leg itself is usually longer.
        * The +/positive/anode has a muchsmaller end inside the LED and the leg itself is usually shorter.
        
1b. Explaining the principles of electricity
    Electricity has many analogs to water.  The Power Supply = the water pump. The water will fill all the space it is given.
    It will the easiest route. If the circuit is broke, all the water will leak out. etc.
        
    REMEMBER an LED must always be protected by a CURRENT-LIMITING Resistor or it will draw maximum current and destroy itself.
        * A resistor can go before OR after the LED and will still protect it.
        * Resistor are non-directional so cannot be the wrong way around.
        
2. Add a Switch to simplest circuit(see images)
    PROBLEM: The schematic and BB views have an error. There are floating connections (connections that do not form a circuit) on the
             unused terminals of the push button. Floating connections may cause detrimental problems to digital circuits, creating
             a 1/on when a 0/off is intended, etc. 

3. Create a circuit to test digital pins(see images and code Strobe Effect Code)
    WARNING: Pins 0,1 and 13 can have problems, I recommend not using them. 
    
4. Digital toggle(see images and code)
    * Again, the switches do have floating connections. This should be fine though it COULD cause floating connection disturbances.
    * The schematic view may be a little confusing but shows quite clearly how all components connected to ground are electrically
      connected to eachtother.

5. Camera Flash
    * The capacitor can be changed to a variable value to have different lengths
    * When the arduino's power is cut off (by button or switch), the capcitor will discharge
      and act as a battery for the resistor and led for a small amonut of time. Very good, very cool.
